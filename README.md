# E-commerce-website
The goal is to develop an e-commerce platform where sellers can list products,
buyers can purchase products, and administrators can manage the overall system. Each user
type will have a dedicated dashboard to manage their activities and view relevant information.

: The platform will allow sellers to create and manage product listings, buyers to
browse and purchase products, and administrators to oversee user management, product
listings, and order processing.
